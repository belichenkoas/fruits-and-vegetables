# The model (Keras) for recognizing fruits and vegetables on mobile devices or microservices

This is a Jupyter notebook using the Keras library for deep learning. The notebook is divided into several sections that demonstrate different aspects of building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.

 **The task**: Prepare a small model for use on mobile devices. The model must recognize fruits and vegetables. The dataset can be taken from open sources.

**Solution**:  
* Base model. Check accuracy using the MobileNetV3Small architecture from the TensorFlow-Keras library;
* Transfer Learning. Building a new model based using the pre-trained base model one to improve the results;
* Evaluate the Model. Evaluates the trained model on the test dataset, printing out metrics such as accuracy and loss.  

This project aims to train a MobileNetV3 Small model on a custom dataset for fruits and vegetables classification. The goal is to achieve high accuracy and improve the baseline model.
